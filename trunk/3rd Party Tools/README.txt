== What are 3rd party tools? ==
===============================

Third party tools are either tools submitted by other users for vbGORE, but are not
maintained or updated by the creator of vbGORE, or tools created for vbGORE by the 
creator but not significant enough to be in the main directory. Any problems with these 
tools will have to be directed to the owners of the tools, and not the vbGORE staff. 
The vbGORE staff will try to help you with the tools, but do not be surprised if they do not
know how to use them.

Any questions on the tools can be directed to the vbGORE Questions section of the forum:

== Bitmap Splitter ==

Description:
Bitmap Splitter will take a single large bitmap and split it into multiple smaller bitmaps
with the specified width and height.

== Codehead's Bitmap Font Generator (CBFG) ==
=============================================
Created by:
Codehead

Home page:
http://www.codehead.co.uk/cbfg/

Description:
CBFG is a program created for making just as the same suggests - bitmap fonts.
Bitmap fonts are used in vbGORE to display the custom fonts, which is much faster
and much more flexable then using system fonts. vbGORE supports, by default, the
Binary Data Format (DAT) file export.

Note that CBFG was not created for vbGORE, but was a tool created by a friend of Spodi's.
It is included into vbGORE with the owner's permission.

The guide for using CBFG can be found on the vbGORE site at:

== Npc and Object Editors ==
============================
Created by: 
Richardf (edited by Spodi)

Originally designed by Spodi for use with the binary files
used before the use of SQL in vbGORE. Now Re-tooled for 
vbGORE 1.0.

You can copy the EditorNPC.exe and the EditorObject.exe
directly to the main vbGORE folder or if you wish you can
Copy the contents of this folder and just choose to NOT
overwrite any files. The only information that is not directly
in these folders is the grh folder itself. Enjoy!

== Grh3RawMaker ==
==================
Created by:
Van

Description:
Grh3RawMaker is a quite outdated program created to help ease the creation of Grh values.
The program still works, but not as well as it did back when it was released back for
version 0.0.2 of vbGORE. It should still get the job done, though.

The guide for Grh3RawMaker can be found on the vbGORE site at:

Description:
The Map Capture tool will create a bitmap copy of all of the tiles on a map, allowing you
to make a quick and easy preview graphic of the map.

PNGOut website:

ADVPng website:
http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/comp-readme.html

Description:
The OptiPNG project is a wrapper for the OptiPNG compression library that is designed to optimize the
file format of PNG files, the main format used by vbGORE, to a smaller size. The library works by restructuring 
the data in the file to be more effecient. Although it is a lossy compression in a technical sense, the lost 
data is not a part of the visual display. Only unused information that does not affect the visual aspect 
of the PNG files is changed.
OptiPNG now also offers compression with pngout, advpng and pngrewrite. The compression takes at least twice 
as long now, but it is definitely worth it. It goes in the order of pngrewrite -> OptiPNG -> pngout -> advpng.

== UPX ==

Created by:

UPX website:
http://upx.sourceforge.net/

Description:
The UPX project is a quick wrapper made for UPX, "the Ultimate Packer for eXecuteables". UPX compresses
EXE files into a smaller size without corrupting them or losing any data. The cost is a bit slower of a runtime,
but nothing you should notice or worry about. The UPX wrapper runs with the parameter --brute which forces the
best compression ratio possible. This project is mostly just a copy-and-paste of the OptiPNG project, but with
minor changes to support using UPX on EXE files instead of OptiPNG on PNG files.

Description:
vbGoreSP is a series of PHP-powered web pages that allows for a great template of displaying your database
information online. It includes plenty of features from who is online, user information, a list of users and
a ton more all wrapped up in a pretty GUI. vbGoreSP connects directly to your vbGORE database, so there are
no modifications required to use it. You can also log in to view your personal profile, or create a new account
directly from vbGoreSP. Recommended tool for anyone using vbGORE that has a web page for their game!
